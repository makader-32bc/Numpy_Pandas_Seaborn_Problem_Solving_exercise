# Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn Problem-Solving Exercises

This repository contains practical exercises focused on **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn** — three core Python libraries widely used in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**.  
It is part of the **Data Science and MLOps course task from Bongodev**, designed to help newcomers develop analytical thinking and real-world problem-solving skills.

---

## 📘 Overview
The exercises in this notebook demonstrate:
- Efficient numerical computation and array manipulation using **NumPy**  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis with **Pandas**  
- Data visualization and pattern exploration using **Seaborn**

Each section provides hands-on examples and code implementations that strengthen understanding of data workflows in Python.
